The goal of the game is to defeat the boss in each level. 
To beat the boss you must catch him when you have more health than him. 
There are enemies on the map (marked with "*") who the boss collects to gain more HP. 
There are also traps("T") and health packs("+") scattered on the map.
When fighting the boss the player has an ability which impacts all squares around him and remove any enemies and damages the boss.
When the player enters a cave he must escape from the spider("S") and his ability is replaced by a decoy("D").
When the decoy is deployed the spider will always chase it instead of the player, the player may pickup the decoy over and over again.
